# Building Splash Screen natively, Android 12, Kotlin

> In this article we would explore & learn how to build a Splash screen with SplashScreen API which was introduced in Android 12.

<br>
A quick recap of a few basic stuff, feel free to skip it.

## What is Splash Screen?

It is the first view that is shown to a user as soon as you tap on the app icon. If you notice a blank white screen (for a
short moment) after tapping on your favourite app, it means it doesn't have a splash screen.

## Why/When I do need it?

Often Splash screen is seen as a differentiator between normal and professional apps. Some use cases where the splash screen fit perfectly are

* When we want to download data before users start using the app.
* If we want to promote app branding and want to display your logo for a longer period of time Or just for a more immersive experience that takes you from the moment you tap on the icon smoothly in whatever the app has to offer.

Till now creating a splash screen was never straightforward and always some amount of boilerplate code added to the application like creating SplashActivity with no view, adding a timer for branding promotion purposes etc. With SplashScreen API all of this is set to go.

## Show me the code

### Step 1: Creating a Theme

Even for the new `SplashScreen` API, we need to create a theme but in `value-v31` folder as few parameters are supported only
in <b>Android 12</b>. Therefore, create a folder in named `value-v31` under `res` folder and add `theme.xml` to it.

And before that, letâ€™s break our splash screen into pieces for simplification.

![Splash Screen placeholder](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/images/splash-screen-composition.png)

* Point 1 represents the icon of the screen.
* Point 2 represents the background colour of the splash screen icon.
* Point 3 represents the background colour of the splash screen.
* Point 4 represents the space for branding logo if needed.

Now, let's assign some values to the corresponding keys that describe the different pieces of the splash screen.

```xml

<style name="SplashActivity" parent="Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar">

    <!-- Point 3-->
    <item name="android:windowSplashScreenBackground">#FFFFFF</item>

    <!-- Point 2-->
    <item name="android:windowSplashScreenIconBackgroundColor">#000000</item>

    <!-- Point 1-->
    <item name="android:windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon">@drawable/ic_realm_logo_250</item>

    <!-- Point 4-->
    <item name="android:windowSplashScreenBrandingImage">@drawable/relam_horizontal</item>
</style>
```

In case you want to use app icon( or don't have a separate icon) as `windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon`, you ignore this
parameter and by default, it will take your app icon.

> Tips & Trick: In case your drawable icon is getting cropped on the Splash screen, then create an app icon from the image
> and then replace the content of `windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon` drawable with the `ic_launcher_foreground.xml`.

> For `windowSplashScreenBrandingImage`, I couldn't find any alternative. Do share in the comment if you find one.

### Step 2: Add the theme to activity

Open AndroidManifest file and add a theme to the activity

``` xml
<activity
 android:theme="@style/SplashActivity">
</activity>
```

In my view, there is no need for a new `activity` class for splash screen, which traditionally was required.
<br>
<br>And now we are all set for the new Android 12 Splash Screen.

Adding animation to the splash screen is also piece of cake, just update the icon drawable with
`AnimationDrawable` and `AnimatedVectorDrawable` drawable and custom parameters for the duration of the animation.

```xml
<item name="android:windowSplashScreenAnimationDuration">1000</item>
```

Earlier, I have also mentioned that the new API also helps with the initial app data download use case, so let see that in action.

In the splash screen activity, we can register for `addOnPreDrawListener` listener which will help to hold off the first
draw on the screen, until data is ready.

``` Kotlin
 private val viewModel: MainViewModel by viewModels()

 override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
     super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
     addInitialDataListener()
     loadAppView()
 }

 private fun addInitialDataListener() {
     val content: View = findViewById(android.R.id.content)
     // This would be called until true is not returned from the condition
     content.viewTreeObserver.addOnPreDrawListener {
         return@addOnPreDrawListener viewModel.isAppReady.value ?: false
     }
 }

 private fun loadAppView() {
     binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
     setContentView(binding.root)
```

### Summary
I really like New `SplashScreen` API which is very clean and easy to use, getting rid of SplashScreen activity altogether. There are a few things I disliked, though

1. Splash screen background support only single colour, waiting for support of vector drawable backgrounds.
2. There is no design spec available for icon & branding image, which makes more of a hit & trial game, still couldn't fix the banding image in my example.
3. Last but not least, SplashScreen UI side feature(`theme.xml`) is only supported from Android 12 and above, so we can't get rid of the old code for now.

You can also check out the complete working example from my GitHub repo. Note: Just running code on the device would just show you white, to see the example close the app recent tray and then click on the app icon again.
